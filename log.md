# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 03, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started my portfolio site by creating the basic structure 
of the site, the html and css files. Linked html to bootstrap library.

**Thoughts:I will develop the site locally and won't deploy it until 
the basic layout and content is complete.** 

**Link to work
